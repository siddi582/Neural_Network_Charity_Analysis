# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of Project
Bek’s come a long way since her first day at that boot camp five years ago—and since earlier this week, when she started learning about neural networks! Now, she is finally ready to put her skills to work to help the foundation predict where to make investments.

With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

![logo](https://github.com/siddi582/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/header.png?raw=true)


* **EIN** and **NAME**—Identification columns
* **APPLICATION_TYPE**—Alphabet Soup application type
* **AFFILIATION**—Affiliated sector of industry
* **CLASSIFICATION**—Government organization classification
* **USE_CASE**—Use case for funding
* **ORGANIZATION**—Organization type
* **STATUS**—Active status
* **INCOME**_AMT—Income classification
* **SPECIAL**_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
* **ASK_AMT**—Funding amount requested
* **IS_SUCCESSFUL**—Was the money used effectively

## Deliverables:
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report.

1. ***Deliverable 1:*** Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. ***Deliverable 2:*** Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. ***Deliverable 3:*** Optimize the Model
4. ***Deliverable 4:*** A Written Report on the Analysis [README.md](https://github.com/siddi582/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis)


## Resources:
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:

* Data Source: `charity_data.csv`, `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5` and `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimzation.h5` 
* Data Tools:  `AlphabetSoupCharity_starter_code.ipynb`, `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb` and `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimzation.ipynb`.
* Software: `Python 3.9`, `Visual Studio Code 1.50.0`, `Anaconda 4.8.5`, `Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4` and `Pandas`


## Before Start:

**Extra Note**
> Basically, there are 3 important layers which are the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. In each layer, there are neurons that are added with weight to produce the outputs through the activation functions (i.e: Sigmoid, ReLU, softmax) which define the output. The neural networks are further divided into shallow and deep neural networks as shown above. Depend on the dataset you are dueling with, you could add many hidden layers to generate a better result.

**Extra Note**
> We should import the necessary library such as Pandas and PyTorch Library. Then, we get the dataset and determine the input and target for prediction. These input and target are converted into NumPy array and split into training, testing and validation set. You can visit my notebook if you are interested to get the details of the source code.

# Deliverable 1:  
## Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model 
### Deliverable Requirements:

Using your knowledge of Pandas and the Scikit-Learn’s `StandardScaler()`, you’ll need to preprocess the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model later in Deliverable 2.

> To Deliver. 

**Follow the instructions below:**

Using the information we have provided in the starter code, follow the instructions to complete the preprocessing steps.

1. Read in the `charity_data.csv` to a Pandas DataFrame, and be sure to identify the following in your dataset:
    - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    - What variable(s) are considered the feature(s) for your model?
2. Drop the `EIN` and `NAME` columns.
3. Determine the number of unique values for each column.
4. For those columns that have more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value.
5. Create a density plot to determine the distribution of the column values.
6. Use the density plot to create a cutoff point to bin "rare" categorical variables together in a new column, `Other`, and then check if the binning was successful.
7. Generate a list of categorical variables.
8. Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and place the variables in a new DataFrame.
9. Merge the one-hot encoding DataFrame with the original DataFrame, and drop the originals.

At this point, your merged DataFrame should look like this:

10. Split the preprocessed data into features and target arrays.
11. Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets.
12. Standardize numerical variables using Scikit-Learn’s `StandardScaler` class, then scale the data.


#### Deliverable 1 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:

* The following preprocessing steps have been performed:
    * The `EIN` and `NAME` columns have been dropped 
    * The columns with more than 10 unique values have been grouped together
    * The categorical variables have been encoded using one-hot encoding
    * The preprocessed data is split into features and target arrays
    * The preprocessed data is split into training and testing datasets 
    * The numerical values have been standardized using the `StandardScaler()` module



# Deliverable 2:  
## Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model 
### Deliverable Requirements:

Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

> To Deliver. 

**Follow the instructions below:**

Using the information we have provided in the starter code, follow the instructions to complete the preprocessing steps.

1. Continue using the `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb` file where you’ve already performed the preprocessing steps from Deliverable 1.
2. Create a neural network model by assigning the number of input features and nodes for each layer using Tensorflow Keras.
3. Create the first hidden layer and choose an appropriate activation function.
4. If necessary, add a second hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.
5. Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.
6. Check the structure of the model.
7. Compile and train the model.
8. Create a callback that saves the model's weights every 5 epochs.
9. Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy.
10. Save and export your results to an **HDF5** file, and name it `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5`.


#### Deliverable 2 Requirements
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:

    * The results are saved to an HDF5 file 


# Deliverable 3:  
## Optimize the Model
### Deliverable Requirements:

Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. If you can't achieve an accuracy higher than 75%, you'll need to make at least three attempts to do so.

**NOTE**
> The accuracy for the solution is designed to be lower than 75% after completing the requirements for Deliverables 1 and 2.

Optimize your model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75% by using any or all of the following:

* Adjusting the input data to ensure that there are no variables or outliers that are causing confusion in the model, such as:
    * Dropping more or fewer columns.
    * Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
    * Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
* Adding more neurons to a hidden layer.
* Adding more hidden layers.
* Using different activation functions for the hidden layers.
* Adding or reducing the number of epochs to the training regimen.

3. Preprocess the dataset like you did in Deliverable 1, taking into account any modifications to optimize the model.
4. Design a neural network model, taking into account any modifications that will optimize the model to achieve higher than 75% accuracy.
5. Create a callback that saves the model's weights every 5 epochs.
6. Save and export your results to an HDF5 file, and name it `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5`.
